# Blackjack

## Project Proposal
- **Title:** Blackjack
- **Team Members:** Peter Leahy
- **Team Name:** Dev21
- **Short Description:** This project aims to simulate the blackjack experience without any of the real risks involved in gambling. This project will follow the standard rules of Blackjack, with the exception that it will be single player instead of 5-9 players. The dealing will be handled by the computer,  the cards will be displayed on the screen for an easy user experience, and all gaming logic will be handled by the computer as well.
- **Inspiration:** I was inspired to make this project by my passion for online gambling. As I am too scared to ever gamble with real money, I find great amounts of joy in playing online Blackjack, as the consequences to going broke are nonexistent. I think this will be a fun challenge to implement all the logic properly. 
- **Rough Implementation Plan:** As the sole member of this project, I will be taking on all the responsibilities of this project. I will need to create a GUI that allows the player to interact with the underlying game logic.
